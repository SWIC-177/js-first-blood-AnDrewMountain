# NodeJS Template Repo

If prompted to install VS Code extensions, do it!

After **cloning** this repo to your computer (remember - don't `clone` into another repo!), don't forget to run: `npm i` and then `cd` into the newly created repo.

**My thoughts on this weeks work!**

During the first two assignments earlier in the week, my first thoughts were on how this class uses git. No other teacher at SWIC, that I know of that is, uses git. I find git a completely useful way to learn coding. With that being said, the more modern approaches such as template literals and arrow functions, are a interesting way to write code. For me personally, I am not a fan of arrow functions, but I will still learn and use them as necessary. Arrow head syntax I do find odd, but this is simply because I am not used to seeing the syntax. Template literals, on the other hand, spark my interest. The syntax for this function is right up my alley. I use this kind of syntax in my C# class on all my projects. By simply using the '${}' syntax, I can embed my expressions within the string. Allowing me to make the code look a lot cleaner. Overall, I feel that I have gained plenty of useful knowledge on how to syntax my code better. Along with gaining a understanding for what node is!
